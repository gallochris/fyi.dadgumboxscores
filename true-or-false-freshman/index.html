<p>The 2018-19 freshman class comes with hype. A lot of it.</p>
<p>NBA draft publications are <a href="https://www.thestepien.com/2018/08/06/early-2019-draft-thoughts-nassir-little/">comparing Nassir Little to Kawhi Leonard</a>.</p>
<p>Opposing college coaches hinted towards <a href="https://247sports.com/college/north-carolina/Article/Coby-White-UNC-Basketball-Signee-Earns-Raves-from-USA-Basketball-Coaches-118777073/">Coby White being the best player</a> on the 18U USA Basketball team this summer.</p>
<p>Rechon &ldquo;Leaky&rdquo; Black has grown to almost 6'8, but he can play point guard. That&rsquo;s an <a href="https://goheels.com/news/2017/11/8/mens-basketball-tar-heels-sign-trio-for-2018-19.aspx?path=mbball">actual quote from Roy Williams</a>.</p>
<p>The hype is heavy.</p>
<p>Will any freshman crack the starting lineup?</p>
<p>Who is a one-and-done?</p>
<p>How does the freshman class fit into this roster?</p>
<p>In order to add some color to these questions, let&rsquo;s revisit how past freshman classes have done just that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This table shows a percentage of possible minutes played and games started for every freshman class since 2003-04. Data is pulled from <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/north-carolina/">Sports Reference</a>, <a href="https://goheels.com/">GoHeels.com</a>, and <a href="https://kenpom.com/">kenpom.com</a>.</p>
<p>See a different look at this information in the following charts:</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use this data to answer some of the true or false statements:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->False<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <em>Freshmen played a higher percentage of minutes during the 2005 Championship season than the 2009 or 2017 Championship seasons.</em></p>
<p>Despite having one-and-dones Marvin Williams and Tony Bradley off the bench, freshmen played a higher percentage of minutes during the 2009 Championship season.</p>
<ul>
<li>2005: 15.3 percent</li>
<li>2009: 16.9 percent</li>
<li>2017: 14.7 percent</li>
</ul>
<p>The freshman class of Ed Davis, Tyler Zeller, Larry Drew, and Justin Watts combined to play 1,282 of a possible 7,605 minutes during the &lsquo;08-09 season.</p>
<p>Tyler Zeller started his first two collegiate games, but later broke his wrist that season. It&rsquo;s possible these numbers would be even higher without that injury.</p>
<p>And just a reminder Ed Davis did things like this off the bench:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0ZqTVJeKjURIbfqIeM-vyw.gif" alt="ed-davis"></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->False<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <em>A freshman has started at least one game in eight of 15 seasons in the Roy Williams era.</em></p>
<p>A freshman has started at least one game in 12 of 15 seasons under Roy Williams. The only seasons without a freshman making a start?</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;07-08: Will Graves and Greg Little</li>
<li>&lsquo;15-16: Luke Maye and Kenny Williams</li>
<li>&lsquo;16-17: Tony Bradley, Brandon Robinson, Seventh Woods, Shea Rush</li>
</ul>
<p>A few of these seasons are extremely close to proving the above statement to be true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin Bohlander started a game as a freshman in the &lsquo;03-04 season</li>
<li>Quentin Thomas started his first collegiate game in 2004 as Raymond Felton was out with a suspension</li>
<li>Tyler Zeller and Ed Davis started two games apiece during the &lsquo;08-09 season</li>
<li>Stilman White and James Michael McAdoo started a combined 5 games during the injury-filled 2012 season</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review this data on a player level. First, this chart shows the top-20 players in percentage of possible minutes played and games started since 2003-04.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0qHs4ov-xAWARgYO19GueA.png" alt="chart-two" title="chart-two"></p>
<p>This table shows a percentage of possible minutes played and games started for <strong>all freshman</strong> since &lsquo;03-04.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->True<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <em>Bobby Frasor is the only player in the Roy Williams era to start every game as a freshman.</em></p>
<p>This was a surprise. Tyler Hansbrough, Brandan Wright, Harrison Barnes, Wayne Ellington, and Justin Jackson were all close to starting every game as a freshman. Frasor quarterbacked the 2006 squad that exceeded any expectations they had at the start of the season.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->True<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <em>Nate Britt started more games as a freshman than Marvin Williams, Tony Bradley, and Danny Green combined.</em></p>
<p>Nate Britt joined Marcus Paige in the backcourt during his freshman season and started 16 of 34 games.</p>
<p>One-and-dones Marvin Williams and Tony Bradley never started a collegiate game. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Both players were drafted in the first round. Danny Green&rsquo;s collegiate career was a bit of foreshadowing to his NBA career. He came off the bench before coming a starter on the roster.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->True<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: <em>Joel James started more games during his freshman season than classmates Brice Johnson and J.P. Tokoto combined.</em></p>
<p>Joel James started 3 games during his freshman campaign, while Brice Johnson started a pair of games and J.P. Tokoto didn&rsquo;t make a start during the same season. While James started more, it was Johnson who earned 26.3 percent of possible minutes to only 19.4 minutes for James.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what does this all mean for Nassir Little, Coby White, and Leaky Black?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out in a few months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear you don&rsquo;t need to start at all to make an impact or pump up your draft stock. See Marvin Williams and Tony Bradley. And while Williams and Bradley never made a start, fellow one-and-doner Brandan Wright started 37 of 38 games during his freshman season.</p>
<p>Whether a player starts or not sometimes has more to do with opportunity at a position than talent. Bobby Frasor started all 31 games as a freshman, but made only 11 more career starts once Ty Lawson was on the roster.</p>
<p>And just because a player doesn&rsquo;t see a lot of minutes or starts as a freshman, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not capable of developing into someone who might find their name in the rafters. Tyler Zeller and Brice Johnson say hello.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping the trio of Little, White, and Black add some highlights similar to these this season.</p>
