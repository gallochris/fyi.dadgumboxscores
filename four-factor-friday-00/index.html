<p>UNC is 3–0 and beating opponents by an average of 29 points.</p>

<ol>
<li>Effective field goal percentage</li>
<li>Turnover percentage</li>
<li>Offensive rebounding</li>
<li>Free throw rate</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s how the Tar Heels are measuring up after 3 games in <strong>effective field
goal percentage</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="efg">eFG%</h3>

<p>Effective field goal percentage takes into account that a 3-point field goal is
worth more than a 2-point field goal.</p>

<p>It’s calculated: <code>eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA * 100</code></p>

<p><strong>OFFENSIVE eFG%</strong></p>

<p>UNC’s offensive eFG% is <strong>55.5%</strong> through 3 games. The Tar Heels have made 21
3-point shots and 100 total shots in 199 shot attempts.</p>

<p><code>eFG% = (.5 * 21 + 100) / 199 * 100 = 55.53%</code></p>

<p>Carolina has scored 142 of its 255 points <strong>(49.8%) in the paint</strong>, while a good
chunk of the other 50% of points has come from behind the 3-point line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/joel-berry-1.html">Joel Berry II</a>
and <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/justin-jackson-4.html">Justin
Jackson</a> are
big reasons why. The junior duo has combined to make 14 of the Tar Heels 21
3-point baskets.</p>

<p>Berry has posted a career-high twice already in 3 games, and as <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeportKid">Adrian
Atkinson</a> points out, Berry is turning in an
<a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/?p=39">eye-opening 75.9 eFG%</a> on his own.</p>

<p>Classmate Justin Jackson is shooting <strong>43% from 3</strong> and <strong>averaging 23.7 points
per 40 minutes</strong> through 3 games. Jackson posted his own career-high, 27 points,
in the season-opener at Tulane too.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GnWoDCg80bu2pc0tDBE4gA.gif" alt="jackson-3" /></p>

<p>Jackson has gotten off to somewhat of a faster start than the previous 2
seasons.</p>

<p>For example, it took Jackson <strong>12 games to make 6 3-pointers in his freshman
season</strong>. He made 4 the first game of his junior campaign, and already has <strong>6
through 3 games this year</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>DEFENSIVE eFG%</strong></p>

<p>The same calculation can be used for Tar Heel opponents. Through 3 games, UNC’s
defensive eFG% is <strong>41.5%</strong>.</p>

<p>This is an impressive mark, albeit against not the stiffest of competition.
Opponents have only scored <strong>35% of their points in the paint</strong> against UNC in 3
games.</p>

<p>Tulane, Chattanooga, and Long Beach State combined to shoot <strong>39% from the
field</strong> and <strong>30% from behind the 3-point line</strong> against Carolina.</p>

<p>It’s clear UNC has shown hints of really good defense early. Carolina <strong>forced
26 turnovers against Chattanooga</strong>, the most they’ve forced since 2008.</p>

<p>And as <a href="https://twitter.com/bhundley">Bobby Hundley</a> points out, the Heels held
Chattanooga to <strong>only .73 points per possession</strong>, which is a mark that was only
topped once a season ago.</p>
