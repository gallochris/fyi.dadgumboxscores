<h1 id="update-fouls-technicals-spreads">Update: Fouls, Technicals, Spreads</h1>

<p>There are new pages added to the referee or officials section of the site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/fouls/">fouls</a> - shows officials and total fouls game-by-game since &lsquo;03-04</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/technicals/">technicals</a> - shows any game with a technical foul (opponent or Carolina) in the Roy Williams era</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/spread/">spread</a> - shows the spread for all available games since &lsquo;03-04, several games are unavailable</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This information is shared alongside the listed officials for each game.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em></p>

<p>It feels like the natural place to put it.</p>

<h2 id="fouls">Fouls</h2>

<p>This is <a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/fouls/">basic information</a>. It shares Carolina fouls, opponent fouls, and combined fouls for every game since &lsquo;03-04 season.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to try to answer questions like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>what&rsquo;s the most amount of fouls called in a Carolina game in the Roy Williams era?</p></li>

<li><p><em><a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2014/pitt-80-unc-75/">58 against Pittsburgh</a> in the 2014 ACC Tournament</em></p></li>

<li><p>what&rsquo;s the most amount of fouls ever called against Carolina and who were the officials of that game?</p></li>

<li><p><em><a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2015/lville-78-unc-68/">33 at Louisville</a> in 2015, officiated by Brian Dorsey / Bill Covington Jr. / Lamar Simpson</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>It has limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>there is no way to distinguish between type of fouls (offensive, shooting foul, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>the filtering isn&rsquo;t always perfect when trying to view fouls based on location or opponent, i.e. there is an official named Duke Edsall and an opponent named Duke</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s tough to draw a ton of conclusions with it in the current state, however, think it&rsquo;s a start to trying to answer more questions around foul totals and an official&rsquo;s tendencies in the future.</p>

<h2 id="technicals">Technicals</h2>

<p>This information is available in all box scores, but it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to find a central place to locate technical fouls. This page was an attempt to create <a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/technicals/">that place</a>.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&rsquo;s safe to assume <em>Team</em> means a technical foul on the head coach, coaching staff, or bench</p></li>

<li><p>it doesn&rsquo;t include which official called the technical foul, so that&rsquo;s a limitation</p></li>

<li><p>the only column that is sortable (on desktop) is the season column right now and same filtering limitations like an official (Duke Edsall) and opponent (Duke) as above</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The player with the most technical fouls since &lsquo;03-04?</p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s a tie. Tyler Hansbrough and John Henson each have 3 apiece.</em></p>

<h2 id="spread">Spread</h2>

<p>First, the intention isn&rsquo;t to sleuth my way into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal">Tim Donaghy situation</a> with sharing the information.</p>

<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s interesting to share the projected result with the actual outcome alongside the officials. It gets the conversation going towards more in-depth research, so don&rsquo;t go making sweeping conclusions about what you see here.</p>

<p>Notes on this information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>all spreads were pulled from <a href="https://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/ncb/teams/pastresults/2017-2018/team2266.html">covers.com</a></p></li>

<li><p>not every game had a listed spread, so several are missing (~23 games), but the game will still show in the table</p></li>

<li><p>red indicates Carolina failed to cover the spread, green means it was covered, and no color indicates a push</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And some fun tidbits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Carolina covered it&rsquo;s largest spread as a favorite (-43.5) against North Carolina Central in the dreadful 2009-10 season</p></li>

<li><p>The 2009 championship team not only won every NCAA Tournament game by double-digits, the squad also covered the spread in all 6 games en route to the title (<em>good teams win, great teams cover - indeed</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>Carolina has been a double-digit underdog only 7 times in 527 games where a spread is available, and it&rsquo;s covered the spread in 4 of those 7 contests</p></li>

<li><p>Biggest underdog? <a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2010/duke-82-unc-50/">15-point dogs at Duke in 2010</a>, and that squad didn&rsquo;t even come close to covering that one</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2>

<p>If you have questions or spot an error with this information, please <a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumboxscores">contact me here</a>. The majority of this information was pulled manually, so entirely possible there is a typo somewhere.</p>

<p>And if you have ideas on how to use this information, please also let me know at the link above. I&rsquo;m open to all ideas.</p>
