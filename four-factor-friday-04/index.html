<p><em>This <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/four-factor-friday-uk-edition-december-16/">article</a>
was originally published at <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/">The Secondary Break</a>, run by <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeportKid">Adrian Atkinson</a></em>.</p>

<p>This edition of Four Factor Friday is centered around the showdown against
Kentucky tomorrow. Let’s get into it.</p>

<h2 id="when-kentucky-has-the-ball">When Kentucky has the ball</h2>

<pre>
    |        | Kentucky |  UNC |
    |:------:|:--------:|:----:|
    |  eFG%  |   53.6   | 44.8 |
    |   TO%  |   14.6   | 21.3 |
    |   OR%  |   39.6   | 29.6 |
    | FTRate |   36.1   | 26.7 |
</pre>

<p>The Wildcats have won games by not turning the ball over and running the
opposition off the floor.</p>

<p>Kentucky only turns it over on <strong>14.6 percent</strong> of their possessions. This mark is among the top-5 in the country, according to <a href="http://kenpom.com/">Ken Pomeroy</a>. The Wildcats have fewer turnovers than their opponent in every game this season.</p>

<p>This Kentucky team takes care of the ball and plays fast. How fast?</p>

<p>Kentucky’s <a href="https://cbbstatshelp.com/efficiency/apl/">average possession length</a>
is about <strong>13.5 seconds</strong>. This means Kentucky shoots the ball about every 13.5 seconds. Pomeroy rates this mark <strong>fourth in the nation</strong>. Past Kentucky teams directed by John Calipari have averaged somewhere around 17.6 seconds in possession length. The 2010 team, run by John Wall, took a shot every 16.2 seconds.</p>

<p>The Wildcats have taken <strong>73 or more shots</strong> in half of their games this year,
including a season-high (83 shots) against Arizona State. In its five-point loss
to UCLA, the Wildcats took 14(!) more shots than the Bruins.</p>

<p>This urgency paired with an <strong>effective field goal percentage of 53.6 percent</strong> has the Wildcats turning in dominant performances. Like when Kentucky scored 1.39 points per possession against Arizona State.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gh8IgjUcAl54KQL8KlROQg.gif" alt="bam-deaaron" /></p>

<p>The Wildcats rely on offensive rebounds, transition offense, and tons of points
in the paint to fuel its offense. Through 10 games this season, Kentucky is pulling down almost <strong>40 percent</strong> of their missed shots.</p>

<p>Kentucky can play four guards at a time, and each one can get to the rim. The
Wildcats have outscored their opponents 424 to 269 in the paint this season. And
about 58 percent of Kentucky’s points come from two-point baskets.</p>

<p>While freshman <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/malik-monk-1.html">Malik Monk</a> is shooting 38.5 percent from three, Kentucky shoots a pedestrian **32.4 percent from behind
the three-point line <strong>as a team</strong>. If you exclude Monk, the rest of Kentucky
only shoots about 29 percent from three.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*A8YOy2-5MqIYHtkdL2wyYA.gif" alt="malik-3" /></p>

<p>As far as free throws, Kentucky owns a <strong>36.1 percent free throw rate</strong>. Coach
Calipari has urged players like <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/malik-monk-1.html">Monk</a> to get to the line more. But classmates <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/deaaron-fox-1.html">De’Aaron Fox</a> and <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/edrice-adebayo-1.html">Bam Adebayo</a> both draw over six fouls per 40 minutes. Those rates are in top-100 in the nation.</p>

<h2 id="when-north-carolina-has-the-ball">When North Carolina has the ball</h2>

<pre>

    |        |  UNC | Kentucky |
    |:------:|:----:|:--------:|
    |  eFG%  | 52.6 |   43.4   |
    |   TO%  | 18.1 |   23.3   |
    |   OR%  | 43.2 |   31.6   |
    | FTRate | 39.7 |   31.8   |
</pre>

<p>North Carolina’s offense hasn’t been the same without point guard <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/joel-berry-1.html">Joel Berry II</a> the past two
games (See <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/unc-position-by-position/">Adrian’s post</a> for more proof).</p>

<p>UNC turns in an <strong>offensive effective field goal percentage of 52.6 percent</strong> on
the year. Without Berry playing at all, Carolina’s eFG% is <strong>43.3 percent</strong> over
the last two games.</p>

<p>Senior <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/isaiah-hicks-1.html">Isaiah Hicks</a> is
6-of-14 from the floor over the last couple games. As of late, Hicks isn’t getting many high-percentage shots.</p>

<p>Watch this entry pass from <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kenny-williams-3.html">Kenny Williams</a> to Hicks against Tennessee. Hicks catches the ball a good distance from the basket, dribbles once into a double-team, and gets his shot blocked.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*G4AUWIP50MuLAjuN-gy0aw.gif" alt="hicks-entry" /></p>

<p>Now, Hicks could of tried to pass out of the double-team here. A better
alternative might be getting Hicks the ball where he doesn’t have to dribble at
all and he can go straight to the basket.</p>

<p>Poor shot selection like this combined with turnovers is a bad recipe for
Carolina. North Carolina is turning it over on <strong>18 percent</strong> of its possessions
this season. That is mark is slightly better than the Division-I average (19.2
percent).</p>

<p>The Tar Heels came up empty on seven straight possessions against Indiana that
helped the Hoosiers build a 17-point lead in the first half that Carolina
couldn’t overcome.</p>

<p>Against Tennessee, UNC went scoreless for a couple four minute stretches in the
first half and trailed by eight at the break. Carolina won that game 73–71, but
it meant erasing their largest halftime deficit to win since 2011.</p>

<p>The Tar Heels need to limit turnovers, and take higher-percentage shots to beat
teams as talented as Kentucky.</p>

<p>Carolina has done that at times this season. For example, take a look this
possession against Wisconsin compared to the one against Tennessee.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*A4siw1XYTSu5y5jepYt8Sg.gif" alt="wisco-possession" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/justin-jackson-4.html">Justin Jackson</a>
delivers a great entry pass to <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/isaiah-hicks-1.html">Isaiah Hicks</a>, finding the senior a couple feet from the basket. Hicks catches and shoots. No dribble. No double-team. Two-points.</p>

<p>When UNC shoots poorly, it relies on second chance points and its ability to
snag offensive rebounds. Carolina leads the country in offensive rebounding
percentage. The Tar Heels rebound about <strong>43 percent of their missed shots</strong>.</p>

<p>This why North Carolina can sometimes shoot worse than its opponent, and still
win games. It has done that against Davidson and Tennessee this season. Carolina
shot worse than its opponent these two games, but outscored them <strong>43–15 in
second chance points</strong>.</p>

<p>Kentucky knows Carolina is going to crash the glass. It’s a clear advantage for
UNC, and even more of an advantage because the Wildcats only rebound about 32
percent of their opponents’ missed shots.</p>

<p>UCLA shot a cartoon-like number (60.6 eFG%) against Kentucky. The Bruins also
beat the Wildcats on the glass a few times to score easy buckets. Freshman <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tj-leaf-1.html">TJ Leaf</a> beat <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/wenyen-gabriel-1.html">Wenyen Gabriel</a> to the ball, and scored a quick bucket after <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/edrice-adebayo-1.html">Bam Adebayo</a> goal-tended here:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*f0QQX46mxZdeJQh7-xNJqw.gif" alt="tj-leaf" /></p>

<p>Could <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kennedy-meeks-1.html">Kennedy Meeks</a> and
<a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tony-bradley-1.html">Tony Bradley</a>
present similar rebounding problems to the Wildcats?</p>

<p>The Meeks-Bradley duo accounts for 46 percent of Carolina’s offensive boards.
Bradley has pulled down seven or more offensive rebounds in three of 11 games
this year. And the freshman’s individual <strong>22.6 percent offensive rebounding
rate leads the country</strong>.</p>

<p>Carolina is getting to the foul line more this season too. The Tar Heels’ <strong>39.7
percent free throw rate</strong> is improved from a year ago. UNC posted a 32.3 percent
free throw rate last season.</p>

<p>This is important because Carolina has won every game where it records a higher free throw rate than its opponent. UNC has made 206 free throws, its opponents
have attempted 178 free throws, a metric that <a href="https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com/where-have-all-the-free-throws-gone-62fd3bf68ff#.59wl3cexe">should please</a>
head coach Roy Williams.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-does-this-all-mean">What does this all mean?</h3>

<p>Carolina has yet to face a team that can score like Kentucky without turning it
over often. While Indiana shot a high percentage to defeat the Tar Heels, the
Hoosiers also turned it over on 22 percent on its possessions keeping Carolina
within striking distance.</p>

<p>The Tar Heels probably won’t shoot like UCLA did against the Wildcats, but
Kentucky should be concerned with Carolina’s ability to beat them on the offensive glass. And while Kentucky likes to run, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZbLywDfA3H4?t=1m20s">Carolina does too</a>.</p>

<h3 id="so-now-for-some-room-temperature-takes">So now for some room-temperature takes</h3>

<p>If the Tar Heels win, it’s likely because they avoid empty possessions
(turnovers/poor shot selection), defend in transition without fouling, and force
the Wildcats (<em>maybe not Monk</em>) to beat them from deep.</p>

<p>If Kentucky wins it’s likely because they limit UNC’s offensive boards, keep
Carolina off the foul line, and make a high percentage of their three-point
shots.</p>

<p>No score prediction. But for fun here is a guess how the four factors might play
out, so you can all tell me when I’m wrong.</p>

<pre>
    |        | UNC | Kentucky |
    |:------:|:---:|:--------:|
    |  eFG%  |  48 |    45    |
    |   TO%  |  17 |    18    |
    |   OR%  |  39 |    31    |
    | FTRate |  45 |    31    |
</pre>    

<p>Roy Williams is 7–5 against Kentucky as UNC’s head coach. John Calipari has
handed out 4 of those losses. Calipari is 4–2 against Carolina.</p>

<p>Check out past UNC-Kentucky games <a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/?filter=kentucky">here</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, if both teams play to their abilities, it should be a lot of fun to
watch.</p>
