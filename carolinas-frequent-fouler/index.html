<h1 id="carolina-s-frequent-fouler">Carolina’s Frequent Fouler</h1>

<p>Isaiah Hicks is one of the most puzzling UNC basketball players of all-time.</p>

<p>Because he can do things most collegiate players dream about, like putting
opponents on a poster as seen here:</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:49%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/RingedOblongHare?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffyi.dadgumboxscores.com%2Fmedia%2F2b1ed7ca1bf80a4c5b1cce04f581dd57%3FpostId%3D9fddcb19cf52' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>But Hicks struggles to stay on the floor because he does a lot of this:</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:49%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MarvelousRecentFoxterrier?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffyi.dadgumboxscores.com%2Fmedia%2F0bfa99ea56f436e542a9aae8facc7b4f%3FpostId%3D9fddcb19cf52' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Isaiah Hicks has committed four or more fouls in 31 of his last 70 career games.
That’s <strong>44 percent</strong>.</p>

<p>While UNC was en route to their run to the NCAA Championship game a year ago, Hicks registered four or more fouls in every NCAA Tournament game except one.</p>

<p>The 6&rsquo;9 senior forward commits <strong>6.2 fouls per 40 minutes</strong> for his career. It’s
impressive and confusing all at the same time.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/">box score data</a>, including play-by-play and
referee assignments, we’ll attempt to answer three questions.</p>

<p>1) How does Isaiah Hicks commit all these fouls?</p>

<p>2) When and where does he commit these fouls?</p>

<p>3) And does Isaiah Hicks have a reputation that contributes to more fouls being
called against him?</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-does-hicks-commit-fouls">How does Hicks commit fouls?</h2>

<p>Hicks has played in 30 of 31 games during the 2016–17 season, and been whistled
for 94 personal fouls.</p>

<p>We reviewed all 94 fouls and put them into five different categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shooting</li>
<li>Off ball or away from basket</li>
<li>Over the back (fighting for rebound)</li>
<li>Reach-in, hand check, or block (when player is driving to basket)</li>
<li>Offensive foul, includes illegal screens</li>
</ol>

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/byssqdu3fu.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_byssqdu3fu videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>



<p>This isn’t perfect by any means, and categorizing these fouls is a subjective
exercise. The video above gives an example of each type of foul.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of how often Hicks is called for each type of foul:</p>

<pre>
    |         Foul Type         | Number of fouls |
    |:-------------------------:|:---------------:|
    |          shooting         |        43       |    
    | reach-in/hand check/block |        17       |    
    | off ball/away from basket |        16       |   
    |       over the back       |        12       |    
    |         offensive         |        6        |  
</pre>

<h3 id="shooting-type-foul">Shooting type foul</h3>

<p>The majority (<strong>46 percent</strong>) of Hicks’ fouls are of the <strong>shooting</strong> variety.
Hicks contests a shot, and the opponent is awarded one or two free throws. This
percentage should maybe even be higher because Hicks is a 6&rsquo;9 forward that plays
in the paint.</p>

<p>Opponents have attempted 110 free throws as a result of Isaiah Hicks committing
a foul. This includes free throws awarded because an opponent is in the bonus,
so not all of these free throws are from a Hicks’ shooting type foul.</p>

<p>The opponents are shooting 62 percent from the charity stripe (68–for-110) as a
result of these fouls. So maybe <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ball don't lie">ball don’t
lie</a> is true
sometimes?</p>

<h3 id="reach-in-hand-check-block">Reach in/hand check/block</h3>

<p>Head coach Roy Williams has said, “A big guy should never make a foul below his
waist and he [Hicks] does that.”</p>

<p>17 of Hicks’ 94 personal fouls (<strong>18 percent</strong>) have come at or below his waist
from a <strong>reach in, hand check, or block</strong>. The majority of these fouls are
committed when an opponent is driving to the basket, like <a href="https://youtu.be/NkMSCkbVA8w?t=4m39s">seen
here</a> when Hicks reaches in while
Kentucky’s De’Aaron Fox sprints towards the basket.</p>

<h3 id="off-the-ball-away-from-basket">Off the ball/away from basket</h3>

<p>Hicks finds himself in some hairy situations at times. Whether it’s <a href="https://youtu.be/N8hnT3fnCUE?t=50m32s">fighting
for a loose bal</a>l or <a href="https://youtu.be/NkMSCkbVA8w?t=18m8s">on his
back</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/1fcB7aO0jFw?t=1h7m">positioning for a
rebound</a>, the whistle finds Hicks. The
senior forward has committed 16 of his 94 personal fouls away from the basket or
off the ball, that’s good for <strong>17 percent.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: Hicks committed one foul in the Georgia Tech game, where it was late-game
situation with a foul to give.</em></p>

<h3 id="over-the-back">Over the back</h3>

<p>As a forward, Hicks finds himself in the paint jostling for defensive and
offensive rebounds. The senior can often grab rebounds over opponents because of
his size.</p>

<p>However, when an opponent does a good job boxing him out, referees are quick to
whistle Hicks for an over the back foul. <strong>13 percent</strong> of Hicks’ personal fouls
are of this <strong>over the back</strong> type when fighting for a rebound, like shown in
the <a href="https://youtu.be/XpWbSHWumI4?t=27m29s">Wisconsin game</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/_QkrJAdO75c?t=1h9m33s">Davidson
game</a>.</p>

<h3 id="offensive">Offensive</h3>

<p>Hicks’ has been whistled for six offensive fouls, including a pair of illegal
screens, and charges like this one from the <a href="https://gfycat.com/SecondaryDimwittedAfricanparadiseflycatcher">Miami
game</a> . These
types of fouls account for <strong>six percent</strong> of Hicks’ 94 total personal fouls
this season, and 12 percent of his 50 turnovers (6 of 50 total turnovers) this
year.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="when-and-where-does-hicks-commit-fouls">When and where does Hicks commit fouls?</h2>

<p>Isaiah Hicks has committed four or more fouls in 13 of his 30 games this season.
This chart shows the amount of fouls committed over the course of these 30
games.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8prI3oujgP0e2kfVXR-K0A.png" alt="Hicks-chart" /></p>

<p>In his last six games played, Hicks has committed at least three or more fouls
in each game (<strong>23 total fouls</strong>). In January, Hicks had a six-game stretch
where he only committed <strong>14 fouls</strong>.</p>

<p>Five of the last six games have come after Hicks missed his first career game
due to a hamstring injury. It’s possible the <a href="https://twitter.com/InsideCarolina/status/836931864552169473">injury
correlates</a> to the
uptick in fouls as of late.</p>

<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

<p>In the 2016–17 season, Hicks has committed &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>41 fouls in 352 minutes played in 15 home games</li>
<li>40 fouls in 220 minutes played in 10 away games</li>
<li>13 fouls in 122 minutes played in five neutral site games</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The senior’s fouls per 40 minutes is much higher (7.3) in away games</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The Notre Dame played in Greensboro is being used as a home game in this
exercise, similar to how the NCAA is <a href="https://twitter.com/InsideCarolina/status/828634240820592640">categorizing
it</a>.</strong></p>

<pre>
    |   Location  | Fouls per 40 min |
    |:-----------:|:----------------:|
    |     Away    |        7.3       |
    |     Home    |        4.7       |
    |   Neutral   |        4.3       |
</pre>    

<p>These rates are a little closer for Hicks’ entire career (141 games). It’s 5.2
fouls per 40 minutes at home, 6.8 fouls per 40 minutes at neutral sites, and 7.1
fouls per 40 minutes on the road for his career.</p>

<h3 id="time-in-the-game">Time in the game</h3>

<p>We also reviewed the time on the clock when Hicks is whistled for his fouls.
This breaks each half into five segments, similar to when TV timeouts are called
after a deadball during collegiate games.</p>

<pre>
    | 1st Half Time of Clock | Fouls | 2nd Half Time on clock | Fouls | 
    |------------------------|-------|------------------------|-------|
    | 20:00 - 16:00          |  9    | 20:00 - 16:00          | 12    | 
    | 15:59 - 12:00          |  7    | 15:59 - 12:00          |  6    |      
    | 11:59 - 8:00           | 14    | 11:59 - 8:00           | 10    |    
    | 7:59 - 4:00            | 12    | 7:59 - 4:00            | 11    |      
    | 3:59 - 0:00            |  5    | 3:59 - 0:00            |  7    |  
    | Total fouls            | 47    | Total fouls            | 46    |
</pre>    

<p>A summary shows 47 fouls called in the first half, and 46 in the second half.
Not showing in the summary is one foul committed in overtime (Clemson).</p>

<p>Hicks frequently commits fouls during the middle of the first half or from the
11:59 minute mark to the 4:00 minute mark. The start of the second half is also
a popular time for Hicks to pick up fouls.</p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>on average, Hicks picks up his first foul <strong>8 minutes</strong> into the first half</li>
<li>fastest to first foul in game is <strong>one minute and 26 seconds</strong> (Wake Forest)</li>
<li>fastest to first foul in second half is <strong>16 seconds</strong> (Louisville)</li>
<li>shortest time between two fouls is <strong>17 seconds</strong> (Wake Forest)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-isaiah-hicks-have-a-reputation-that-contributes-to-more-fouls-being-called-against-him">Does Isaiah Hicks have a reputation that contributes to more fouls being called against him?</h2>

<p>In order to answer this question, we reviewed the officials assigned to every
game Isaiah Hicks has played in his career where he has committed at least three
or more fouls.</p>

<p>It’s a strong sample size of <strong>72 games</strong> out of a possible 142 career games, or
<strong>51 percent of Hicks’ career contests</strong>. If you want to see a list of all
officials for every game in the 2016–17 season, go to:
<a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/officials/">dadgumboxscores.com/officials</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of the most frequent officials on the court when Isaiah Hicks has
committed three fouls or more in his career to date (March 2, 2017):</p>

<pre>
    |     Ref Name    | Number of games |
    |:---------------:|:---------------:|
    |    Mike Eades   |        9        |
    |   Roger Ayers   |        6        |
    |    Tim Nestor   |        6        |
    |   Bryan Kersey  |        5        |
    |    Jeff Clark   |        5        |
    | Michael Roberts |        5        |

</pre>

<p>Mike Eades and Roger Ayers, a couple of the most <a href="https://twitter.com/kenpomeroy/status/828761841916448768">popular
officials</a> in
collegiate basketball, top the list. Both Eades and Ayers work a lot of top-tier
games and they’re located on the east coast, meaning it’s likely these two will
work a lot of UNC games. For example &hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Ayers/Eades worked the <a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2016/unc-83-cuse-66/">national semi-final game against
Syracuse</a> last season
with Jeff Clark</li>
<li>Ayers was on the court in the game <a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2017/kentucky-103-unc-100/">against
Kentucky</a> this
season</li>
<li>Ayers/Eades also worked the ACC Tournament Final <a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2016/unc-61-uva-57/">against
Virginia</a> with Bryan
Kersey (<a href="http://www.theacc.com/news/acc-names-bryan-kersey-coordinator-of-men-s-basketball-officiating-04-19-2016">Kersey is now the coordinator of ACC
officials</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>While Eades and Ayers are some of the most respected officials in all of
collegiate basketball, they’re also the most frequent officials on the court
when Isaiah Hicks is whistled with fouls. This duo has been on the court
together three times over these 72 games, most amongst any officials during that
span.</p>

<h3 id="does-this-mean-hicks-has-a-reputation-that-leads-to-more-fouls">Does this mean Hicks has a reputation that leads to more fouls?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I do believe he has a reputation and I think some officials get carried away with the things that they hear, but I don’t think an official goes into the game
thinking, ‘I’m going to call a foul on Isaiah.’ He puts himself in bad spots
sometimes and needs to just stay away from that junk. A big guy should never
make a foul below his waist and he does that and shouldn’t get caught and
tangled up with people and he does that sometimes. I think sometimes the calls
are very unfortunate for him, too.</p>

<p>— Roy Williams, <a href="http://www.scout.com/college/north-carolina/story/1758845-williams-live-hicks-enduring-tough-stretch">THSN Radio
Show</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Head coach Roy Williams says <strong>yes</strong>, Hicks does have a reputation. If you
review previous foul calls, it’s possible officials have a cognitive bias
towards Hicks. Why?</p>

<p>Because some of the foul calls against him have been as curious as the Oxford,
NC native’s <a href="https://twitter.com/averytrendel/status/814303476872347648">mid-season
hairdo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="here-are-a-few-examples">Here are a few examples:</h2>

<h3 id="on-his-back-against-kentucky">On his back against Kentucky</h3>

<p>Hicks picked up his third foul against Kentucky about 25 seconds after his
second foul call while laying on his back. This prompted Roy Williams to throw
his jacket and receive a technical foul.</p>

<p>The official who called this foul and the technical? Roger Ayers.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:52%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WideeyedNauticalDonkey?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffyi.dadgumboxscores.com%2Fmedia%2F414a85e472538bf1acfaae1088541e18%3FpostId%3D9fddcb19cf52' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<h3 id="block-against-syracuse-in-final-four-last-season">Block against Syracuse in Final Four last season</h3>

<p>Mike Eades whistled this blocking foul on Hicks with 11 seconds to go in the
first half against Syracuse in the 2016 Final Four. It was a play where Hicks
was clearly outside the cylinder, and still charged with his third personal
foul.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:52%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/HollowBlissfulCrow?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffyi.dadgumboxscores.com%2Fmedia%2Fd42077d81e9c0d8c3fdfeba133444ee9%3FpostId%3D9fddcb19cf52' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<h3 id="reach-in-against-virginia-tech">Reach in against Virginia Tech</h3>

<p>With only two seconds left in the half, Hicks is called with a reach in on a
play where two other players ended up on the ground. Assistant coach Steve
Robinson’s reaction says it all.</p>

<p>Ayers and Eades both on the court for this one, Eades is the one who blew the
whistle with a questionable view of the play.</p>

<p>Yes, Hicks puts himself in tough situations that make it easier for fouls to go
against him. Let’s acknowledge officials are human, and they do expect him to
commit fouls in certain situations.</p>

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:51%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/RelievedSourIndianhare?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffyi.dadgumboxscores.com%2Fmedia%2F438f3b0c6786f8ecb645e21aa3ba3c79%3FpostId%3D9fddcb19cf52' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<hr />

<p>Isaiah Hicks will play his last game in the Dean E. Smith Center Saturday night
against Duke. Here’s hoping the senior avoids fouls and helps UNC make another
NCAA title run to close his career.</p>
