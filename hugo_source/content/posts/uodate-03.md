# Update: Four factors for every game 

If you don't know, the [four factors](https://cbbstatshelp.com/four-factors/intro/) explain why a team wins or loses. They're the building blocks to efficiency. The four factors are:

1. Shooting (eFG)
2. Avoiding turnovers (TO%)
3. Offensive rebounding (OR%)
4. Getting to the foul line (FTRate)

I've now added four factors and points-per-possession (PPP) for every game since 2003-04 on this [page on the site](https://dadgumboxscores.com/four-factors/). 

This was a tall task. For any games from the '03-04 to the '06-07 season, the four factors had to be calculated manually. I even built a [four factor calculator](https://dadgumboxscores.com/calc/) to make this a bit easier. 

At the start of the '07-08 season, a great (and free) site came in handy: [barttorvik.com](http://barttorvik.com/team.php?type=efg&team=North+Carolina) 

While most people are aware of [kenpom.com](https://kenpom.com/), Bart Torvik's site is on the same level. Tons of useful information, including box scores since the '07-08 season that calculate some of the four factors for you. 

Here are a few interesting tidbits using this four factor information: 

- The 2009 Championship team scored over 1 PPP in every single game 
- The 2018 team scored the lowest PPP in a game (0.62 against Michigan State) and also scored the highest PPP in a loss, 1.28 against Miami's 1.32 PPP 
- The 2004 squad attempted 50 free throws and 51 field goals in a win against Maryland, good for a 98.0 free throw rate  

Hope to do more with this data in the future.

## Mobile access

It's been a challenge to present all this information in a way that's useful on mobile devices. I've made some adjustments to make the tables and information easier to access. 

For example, here's how the [officials page](https://dadgumboxscores.com/officials/) looks now on mobile:

The same changes exist for all other tables on the site. Big thanks to Matt Smith, and [his recommendation](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/MyqmdM) on a simple responsive table.
