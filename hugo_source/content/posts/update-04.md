# Update: Fouls, Technicals, Spreads  

There are new pages added to the referee or officials section of the site: 

- [fouls](https://dadgumboxscores.com/fouls/) - shows officials and total fouls game-by-game since '03-04 

- [technicals](https://dadgumboxscores.com/technicals/) - shows any game with a technical foul (opponent or Carolina) in the Roy Williams era

- [spread](https://dadgumboxscores.com/spread/) - shows the spread for all available games since '03-04, several games are unavailable 


This information is shared alongside the listed officials for each game. 

*Why?* 

It feels like the natural place to put it. 

## Fouls 

This is [basic information](https://dadgumboxscores.com/fouls/). It shares Carolina fouls, opponent fouls, and combined fouls for every game since '03-04 season. 

This is an attempt to try to answer questions like the following: 

- what's the most amount of fouls called in a Carolina game in the Roy Williams era? 

- *[58 against Pittsburgh](https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2014/pitt-80-unc-75/) in the 2014 ACC Tournament*

- what's the most amount of fouls ever called against Carolina and who were the officials of that game? 

- *[33 at Louisville](https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2015/lville-78-unc-68/) in 2015, officiated by Brian Dorsey / Bill Covington Jr. / Lamar Simpson* 

It has limitations: 

- there is no way to distinguish between type of fouls (offensive, shooting foul, etc.)

- the filtering isn't always perfect when trying to view fouls based on location or opponent, i.e. there is an official named Duke Edsall and an opponent named Duke 

It's tough to draw a ton of conclusions with it in the current state, however, think it's a start to trying to answer more questions around foul totals and an official's tendencies in the future. 

## Technicals 

This information is available in all box scores, but it's nearly impossible to find a central place to locate technical fouls. This page was an attempt to create [that place](https://dadgumboxscores.com/technicals/).

A few notes: 

- it's safe to assume *Team* means a technical foul on the head coach, coaching staff, or bench 

- it doesn't include which official called the technical foul, so that's a limitation  

- the only column that is sortable (on desktop) is the season column right now and same filtering limitations like an official (Duke Edsall) and opponent (Duke) as above 

The player with the most technical fouls since '03-04? 

*It's a tie. Tyler Hansbrough and John Henson each have 3 apiece.* 

## Spread 

First, the intention isn't to sleuth my way into a [Tim Donaghy situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_betting_scandal) with sharing the information. 

But I do think it's interesting to share the projected result with the actual outcome alongside the officials. It gets the conversation going towards more in-depth research, so don't go making sweeping conclusions about what you see here. 

Notes on this information: 

- all spreads were pulled from [covers.com](https://www.covers.com/pageLoader/pageLoader.aspx?page=/data/ncb/teams/pastresults/2017-2018/team2266.html)

- not every game had a listed spread, so several are missing (~23 games), but the game will still show in the table 

- red indicates Carolina failed to cover the spread, green means it was covered, and no color indicates a push 

And some fun tidbits: 

- Carolina covered it's largest spread as a favorite (-43.5) against North Carolina Central in the dreadful 2009-10 season

- The 2009 championship team not only won every NCAA Tournament game by double-digits, the squad also covered the spread in all 6 games en route to the title (*good teams win, great teams cover - indeed*)

- Carolina has been a double-digit underdog only 7 times in 527 games where a spread is available, and it's covered the spread in 4 of those 7 contests 

- Biggest underdog? [15-point dogs at Duke in 2010](https://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2010/duke-82-unc-50/), and that squad didn't even come close to covering that one 

## Questions?
