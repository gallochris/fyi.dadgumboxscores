# Update: Better tables, spelling errors, and filterable factors!

We're now using Bootstrap 4 and Datatables to host all the data. You'll notice the tables are formatted slightly different, and the responsiveness is less confusing. 

If you're still accessing the four factors on a mobile device, plan to use landscape. It will make it much easier to view the data. 

And while we're mentioning the four factors, you'll now find a search box to filter games and see the four factor data. This makes it easier if you want to see how Carolina has historically performed across the four factors against an opponent. 

For example, here is how Carolina has performed against Duke: [https://dadgumboxscores.com/four-factors/?filter=duke](https://dadgumboxscores.com/four-factors/?filter=duke)

A few other small tweaks and changes: 

- _conference_ is now _league_ - this helps with filtering issues because conference and non-conference returned the same results, so _league_ = _ACC_ 

- the footer now shows the accurate year, yes, it's 2019 and this site has been running since 2016 

- removed a duplicate entry for four factors, database is now 569 games strong 

- adjusted the [purpose](https://dadgumboxscores.com/purpose/) page fixing obvious spelling errors and adding [@5th_Factor](https://twitter.com/5th_Factor) as someone to follow
