# Four Factor Friday: Nov. 18, 2016

{{< youtube 6O3-7QenN8I >}}

UNC is 3–0 and beating opponents by an average of 29 points.

1.  Effective field goal percentage
2.  Turnover percentage
3.  Offensive rebounding
4.  Free throw rate

Here’s how the Tar Heels are measuring up after 3 games in **effective field
goal percentage**.

### eFG%

Effective field goal percentage takes into account that a 3-point field goal is
worth more than a 2-point field goal.

It’s calculated: `eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA * 100`

**OFFENSIVE eFG%**

UNC’s offensive eFG% is **55.5%** through 3 games. The Tar Heels have made 21
3-point shots and 100 total shots in 199 shot attempts.

`eFG% = (.5 * 21 + 100) / 199 * 100 = 55.53%`

Carolina has scored 142 of its 255 points **(49.8%) in the paint**, while a good
chunk of the other 50% of points has come from behind the 3-point line.

[Joel Berry II](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/joel-berry-1.html)
and [Justin
Jackson](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/justin-jackson-4.html) are
big reasons why. The junior duo has combined to make 14 of the Tar Heels 21
3-point baskets.

Berry has posted a career-high twice already in 3 games, and as [Adrian
Atkinson](https://twitter.com/FreeportKid) points out, Berry is turning in an
[eye-opening 75.9 eFG%](http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/?p=39) on his own.

Classmate Justin Jackson is shooting **43% from 3** and **averaging 23.7 points
per 40 minutes** through 3 games. Jackson posted his own career-high, 27 points,
in the season-opener at Tulane too.

Jackson has gotten off to somewhat of a faster start than the previous 2
seasons.

For example, it took Jackson **12 games to make 6 3-pointers in his freshman
season**. He made 4 the first game of his junior campaign, and already has **6
through 3 games this year**.

**DEFENSIVE eFG%**

The same calculation can be used for Tar Heel opponents. Through 3 games, UNC’s
defensive eFG% is **41.5%**.

This is an impressive mark, albeit against not the stiffest of competition.
Opponents have only scored **35% of their points in the paint** against UNC in 3
games.

Tulane, Chattanooga, and Long Beach State combined to shoot **39% from the
field** and **30% from behind the 3-point line** against Carolina.

It’s clear UNC has shown hints of really good defense early. Carolina **forced
26 turnovers against Chattanooga**, the most they’ve forced since 2008.

And as [Bobby Hundley](https://twitter.com/bhundley) points out, the Heels held
Chattanooga to **only .73 points per possession**, which is a mark that was only
topped once a season ago.
