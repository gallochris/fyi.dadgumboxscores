# Four Factor Friday: Nov. 25, 2016

In this edition of Four Factor Friday, we’ll take a closer look at how the Tar
Heels are measuring up in [offensive rebounding percentage](https://cbbstatshelp.com/four-factors/offensive-rebounding/).


## OR%

A team’s ability to increase its number of possessions, gives it a greater
chance to score points and win games. Offensive rebounding is the main factor
for a team to gain possessions.

It’s calculated by taking a team’s total offensive rebounds and comparing it to
its opponents’ defensive rebounds.

**OFFENSIVE OR%**

UNC has grabbed 113 total offensive rebounds to its opponents 127 defensive
rebounds this season. [KenPom.com](http://kenpom.com/stats.php?s=RankOR_Pct)
rates UNC second in the country with a **46.6% offensive rebounding rate**.

This means on a Carolina missed shot or free throw, the team is rebounding the
ball **about 47%** of the time.

In the last 4 games, UNC has **outscored its opponents 85–32 in second chance
points**.

Freshman [Tony Bradley](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tony-bradley-1.html) (24.4) and senior [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kennedy-meeks-1/gamelog) (22.6) **rank 1 and 2 nationally in individual offensive rebounding percentage** according to [KenPom.com](http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=North+Carolina).

This isn’t all that of surprise for folks that have followed the Tar Heels over
the years. In the previous 2 seasons, Carolina has rated in the top-5 in the
country in offensive OR%.

**DEFENSIVE OR%**

What is coming as a surprise is UNC showing the ability to prevent their
opponents from snagging offensive rebounds.

The Tar Heels post a **29.9% defensive rebounding percentage** through 7 games
this season. Opponents are getting the rebound **about 30%** of the time on
their missed shots or free throws.

However, Carolina turned in one of its best defensive rebounding efforts in a
71–56 win over Wisconsin in the Maui Invitational final.

As [Brian Barbour](https://twitter.com/briancbarbour) revealed, UNC didn’t allow
a single offensive rebound in the first half against Wisconsin. The Badgers only finished with 4 total offensive rebounds.

[Kennedy Meeks](http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kennedy-meeks-1/gamelog) was
a big reason why. The senior corralled a **career-high 13 defensive rebounds**
in the win over Wisconsin as shown in Jim Hawkins' photo (Inside Carolina). 

![meeks-board](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3mV9GKsP2owwZqA_XliDLg.jpeg)

Meeks grabbed **116 total defensive rebounds in 33 games** a year ago. He’s
already recorded **43 defensive rebounds in 7 games** this year.

Defensive rebounding is one of the biggest voids to fill from a year ago with
the departure of Brice Johnson. While the numbers will change with more stiff
competition looming, it’s encouraging to see the the Tar Heels limiting second
chance points and their opponents’ possessions thus far this year.

*Carolina is back in action Wednesday, November 30 at Indiana. It’s a true road
game and the start of quite the stretch for UNC as 20 of the Tar Heels remaining
25 games are against Top-100 opponents according to [KenPom.com](http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=North+Carolina)*.
