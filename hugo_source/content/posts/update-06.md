# Update: Shots! Shots! Shots! 2PT, 3PT, and free throws

After a good amount of data collecting and cleaning, the site now has shooting data for all 586 games in the Roy Williams era. This includes Carolina and opponent game-by-game data for the following: 

- two-point shots
- three-point shots
- free throws 

You can find it here: <a href="https://dadgumboxscores.com/shooting-offense/" >https://dadgumboxscores.com/shooting-offense/</a>

If you're accessing this data on a mobile device, plan to use landscape. It makes it much easier to view the data. 

There is a search box to filter games and see the shooting data. For example, here is how to view Carolina's free throw data against Duke since the '03-04 season: [https://dadgumboxscores.com/shooting-free-throws-offense/?filter=duke](https://dadgumboxscores.com/shooting-free-throws-offense/?filter=duke)

A lot of this work is simply publishing the data. We haven't yet used it for any sort of in-depth analysis, however, it's something we hope to explore in the future. 

As a half-baked example, it's fascinating to see free throw attempts and three-point attempts over time. College basketball has changed significantly as teams attempt more three-point shots and fewer free throws, check out the following graph:

![free throws minus threes](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z-LB0TUPfZhQ_pjINrTiYQ.png)

This shows Carolina's offensive free throw attempts minus three-point attempts for the last 586 games. 

- Carolina has attempted more three-point shots than foul shots in 171 of 586 games (almost 29%)
- 44 of those 171 games (26%) have come over the last two seasons ('17-18, '18-19) 
- Tar Heels are modernizing right before our eyes and becoming more perimeter oriented, will it last? 

Hope to explore this data more in the offseason, and a few projects on my imaginary to-do list: 

- convert this data into a [shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- help with [Adrian Atkinson's](https://twitter.com/FreeportKid/status/1108400266905292800) Carolina Charting Project, check it out, Adrian's work is unparalleled
- share more blog posts using this data
