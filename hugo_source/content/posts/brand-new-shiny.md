# Dadgum Box Scores 2.0 

The long offseason project is ready for some eyeballs. In the [last update](/update-06), I wrote I wanted to convert all the data on this site into a Shiny App.

And that's now a reality. 

You can see the new app here: [app.dadgumboxscores.com](https://app.dadgumboxscores.com) 

## Who cares? 

If you're interested in stats, the history of Carolina basketball in the Roy Williams Era, and like to play with data . . . maybe you do? 

The app makes its much easier to sort, filter, and locate past information. The complete dataset available in the app includes the following information for all 586 games in the Roy Williams Era: 

- box scores: every box score filterable by result, opponent, and season 
- officials: a list of all refs and total fouls game-by-game
- four factors: game-by-game numbers of the building blocks of efficiency
- shooting data: game-by-game shooting stats on both offense and defense
- plots: game-by-game plots using different metric

Plus you can check out the Dadgum Data tab to download this data on your own. For free. All files are in CSV format. 

If you're accessing this app on a mobile device, plan to use landscape. It makes it much easier to view the data. 

## Example using the app

For example, using the plots you can view Carolina's Free Throw Rate and Three-Point Rate game-by-game and compare it to opponent's rates for the same season or different seasons. 

This shows overall trends in a season, and how it's much more likely for teams to attempt a three-point shot than a foul shot in recent seasons.

## Next steps? 

I'm far from a data scientist. More like a data janitor. This app took a ton of time, frustration, trial and error, and help from the Internet to build. 

So, I would like your help. Here is how you can help: 

- if you find this app useful, share it with other people 
- if you download the data and find an error, let me know 
- if the app doesn't work, shake your fist at me and ask me to fix it 
- if you have suggestions to improve it, tell me how

The best way to contact me is [@dadgumboxscores](https://dadgumboxscores.com).

Now with this app, the plan is to write more or try to use the data for more observations. A few ideas I'm kicking around include: 

- most frequent referees, maybe a word cloud to show frequencies of officials 
- a season-by-season post using game-by-game data
- let's get weird: the most random games in the Roy Williams Era 
- adding player data or sharing one-off charts/graphs 

_Thanks for reading this far_. 

**P.S.**: Did you know Carolina is 33-1 in the Roy Williams Era when posting an effective field goal percentage of 65 or higher? 

Any ideas of the lone loss? 

Ping me [@dadgumboxscores](https://dadgumboxscores.com) with the answer.
