<h1 id="four-factor-friday-dec-2-2016">Four Factor Friday: Dec. 2, 2016</h1>

<p>The third addition of Four Factor Friday is specific. Since the Tar Heels only
played 1 game in the last week, we’ll breakdown the loss to Indiana across all
<a href="https://cbbstatshelp.com/four-factors/intro/">four factors</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Effective field goal percentage</li>
<li>Turnover percentage</li>
<li>Offensive rebounding</li>
<li>Free throw rate</li>
</ol>

<script src="//gist.github.com/gallochris/4e15a5e78e881cd35acfcb60697c7cd6.js"></script>

<h3 id="efg">eFG%</h3>

<p>Carolina posted a <strong>44.3% offensive effective field goal percentage</strong>. The Tar
Heels made 24 of 61 shots. Only 6 of those 24 shots were from behind the 3-point
line.</p>

<p><code>eFG% = (.5 x 6) + 24 / 61 x 100 = 44.3%</code></p>

<p>UNC’s shot selection wasn’t all that strong early. The first shot attempt of the
game by <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/nate-britt-1.html">Nate
Britt</a> with the
shot clock winding down set the tone.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wf17xA8CtFgBGTOo-o_zWQ.gif" alt="nate-britt-shot-indiana" /></p>

<p>Give credit to Indiana’s defense. The Hoosiers held the Tar Heels scoreless in 7 straight possessions en route to building an early 17-point lead. Senior <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/isaiah-hicks-1.html">Isaiah Hicks</a> didn’t attempt a single shot in first 20 minutes, and <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/joel-berry-1.html">Joel Berry II</a> was 1-for-6 from the field in the 1st frame.</p>

<p>UNC did get some easier buckets in the 2nd half. The first 3 shots of the second
half were a layup from <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/justin-jackson-4.html">Justin Jackson</a>, layup by <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kennedy-meeks-1.html">Kennedy Meeks</a>, and then a dunk by Meeks.</p>

<p>This surge cut the Hoosiers’ lead to 4 with under 5 minutes to play. Indiana added a free throw to extend the lead to 62–57 before a critical Tar Heel possession.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6-gO5imbaLPb851cUZ64Sw.gif" alt="kenny-williams-shot-indiana" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kenny-williams-3.html">Kenny Williams</a>
took a long 2-point shot that went in-and-out. If Williams’ shot falls, the
Hoosier lead is cut to 3 with a media timeout coming soon.</p>

<p>Instead, Indiana drilled a 3-point shot on its next possession, and the lead
went back to 8 points.</p>

<p>Carolina’s previous 3 shots prior to that possession all came from close range,
including a runner in the lane from <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/joel-berry-1.html">Berry II</a> and a <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tony-bradley-1.html">Tony Bradley</a> fast-break dunk. Williams shot selection wasn’t awful here, however, the Tar Heels might have preferred higher percentage shot in the paint?</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There’s a fair statistical chance that last night will remain UNC’s worst showing on offense in all of 2016-17. <br><br>Hoosiers, I salute you.</p>&mdash; John Gasaway (@JohnGasaway) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnGasaway/status/804335518481780736">December 1, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It wasn’t pretty on offense, but again give some credit to Indiana. UNC only
scored <strong>0.93 points per possession</strong> (PPP) Wednesday night. Its lowest PPP since
scoring .92 in a <a href="http://dadgumboxscores.com/boxes/2016/lville-71-unc-65/">loss to Louisville last season</a>.</p>

<p>Indiana posted a <strong>55.8% effective field goal percentage</strong>. The Hoosiers knocked
down 8 shots from behind the 3-point line, and we’re 25–of-52 from the field
overall.</p>

<p><code>eFG% = (.5 x 8) + 25 / 52 x 100 = 55.8%</code></p>

<p>No surprise that’s good for the <strong>highest field eFG% goal percentage allowed</strong> by UNC this season (Dec. 2, 2016).</p>

<p>Indiana got off to a fast start making its first 3 shots, including a pair from
behind the 3-point line. The backcourt Carolina ran with the most in the Maui
Invitational, Berry and Williams, only <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeportKid/status/804164602976149504">played 26 seconds
together</a> in the
first half.</p>

<p>Berry picked up a couple of fouls in the first 5 minutes. And Williams, who did
not start, struggled in the first half playing only 5 minutes. This left a lot
of folks curious, and for good reason. Because Williams is known as one of the
Tar Heels’ better defenders.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeportKid">Adrian Atkinson</a> calls it, the <a href="http://www.thesecondarybreak.us/the-kenny-williams-effect/">Kenny Williams effect</a>. Lineup data from <a href="http://thesecondarybreak.us14.list-manage.comsubscribe?u=f2b3b790f73fb9377c3966682&amp;id=3fb48c6882">Atkinson’s newsletter</a>
shows opponents prior to Indiana posting an eFG% of <strong>47% against a backcourt
of Berry-Britt</strong> versus <strong>37% against a Berry-Williams</strong> backcourt.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="turnover-percentage-to">Turnover Percentage (TO%)</h3>

<p>Carolina and Indiana’s matchup featured roughly 71 possessions Wednesday. In
those 71 possessions, UNC committed 12 turnovers and Indiana turned it over 16
times.</p>

<p>Carolina posted a <strong>16.7 TO%</strong>, turning it over on about 17% of their
possessions. The Tar Heels avoided turnovers a bit better than Indiana’s
<strong>22.2% clip</strong>.</p>

<p>8 of UNC’s 12 turnovers came in the 1st half, yet another reason why the
Hoosiers led by as many as 17 at one point.</p>

<p>Indiana’s wasted possessions did let Carolina hang around, but in the end, the
Hoosiers were able to close it out down the stretch.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="offensive-rebounding-or">Offensive Rebounding (OR%)</h3>

<p>UNC and Indiana both rank in the top-10 in the country in offensive rebounding
percentage according to <a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom.com</a>.</p>

<p>Carolina edged Indiana Wednesday snagging 13 offensive rebounds to IU’s 29
defensive rebounds, good for a <strong>OR% of 30.95%</strong>.</p>

<p><code>OR% = 13 / (13+ 29) = 30.95</code></p>

<p>The Hoosiers pulled down 8 offensive rebounds to UNC’s 24 defensive rebounds, or
a <strong>25% offensive rebounding percentage</strong>.</p>

<p>UNC did a solid job on the glass, however, this stat is somewhat misleading. In
order for Indiana to have a chance to get offensive rebounds, they’ve got to
miss shots.</p>

<p>Remember, the Hoosiers shot almost 50% from the field in the 9-point victory.
UNC shot a lower percentage, giving it more opportunities to grab offensive
boards.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="free-throw-rate">Free Throw Rate</h3>

<p>Ugly night at the free throw line for Carolina. It attempted 22 free throws and
61 total shots, translating to a <strong>36.07% FTRate</strong>.</p>

<p><code>FTRate = 22 / 61 x 100 = 36.07%</code></p>

<p>UNC got to the line a fair amount. But the Tar Heels could have added some much
needed points from the charity stripe, and even more attempts.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3-point game if UNC is making all of its free throws. Missed six and would have earned three more if not for 3 missed front end of 1&amp;1s</p>&mdash; R.L. Bynum (@RL_Bynum) <a href="https://twitter.com/RL_Bynum/status/804162690704900096">December 1, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Carolina made only 13 of 22 free throws and missed the front-end of 3
one-and-one attempts in the 1st half Wednesday.</p>

<p>Indiana on the other hand, registered a <strong>51.9% FTRate</strong>. IU attempted 27 free
throws and 52 field goals.</p>

<p>Carolina committed some silly fouls, like this one from Isaiah Hicks about 90
feet from the opponents’ basket.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VbkNrX4AgfbtteGz9rtKwA.gif" alt="hicks-foul-indiana" /></p>

<p>The 27 free throw attempts are the <strong>most by a Tar Heel opponent</strong> this season.
Carolina opponents only posted more than 27 free throw attempts 3 times in 40
games in the 2015–16 season.</p>

<p>Free throw rate is a <a href="https://fyi.dadgumboxscores.com/where-have-all-the-free-throws-gone-62fd3bf68ff#.c0uxsxulx">maddening metric</a> for UNC lately. Roy Williams wants his team to make more free throws than its opponent attempts because that often leads to a successful season. And Carolina hasn’t done that since the 2011–12 season.</p>

<p>Prior to the Indiana game, Carolina had made 135 made free throws to its
oppopents’ 105 attempted free throws (<strong>+30 margin</strong>).</p>

<p>After the loss to IU, Carolina has now made 148 free throws to its opponents’
132 free throw attempts (<strong>+16 margin</strong>).</p>

<hr />

<p>In short, Carolina rebounded offensively and avoided turnovers a little bit
better than Indiana, but the Hoosiers shot a higher percentage and got to the
foul line more often building a big lead early. That’s a recipe for UNC’s first
loss of the season, and an impressive performance by IU.</p>

<p><em>The Tar Heels return to Chapel Hill for a 3-game homestand starting with
Radford Sunday, before another showdown with a top-opponent in Kentucky on Dec.
17 in Las Vegas.</em></p>
