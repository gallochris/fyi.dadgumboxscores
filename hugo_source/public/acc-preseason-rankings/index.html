<p>Operation basketball is slated for October 24, so let&rsquo;s explore how the preseason rankings line up with the end of the regular season. This is for teams only, not for player preseason All-ACC teams.</p>
<p>Below is a chart comparing preseason rankings to end of regular season rankings in the conference since the start of the 2003-04 season. A few observations from exploring these rankings.</p>
<h2 id="carolina-atop-the-rankings">Carolina atop the rankings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Carolina has been selected as preseason number 1 <strong>six times</strong> (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2016)</li>
<li>The Tar Heels finished the regular season with league&rsquo;s top ranking in <strong>five of those six years</strong> (hint: not 2010)</li>
<li>Three times Carolina has finished the regular season atop the rankings despite being picked lower in the preseason (picked second in 2017, third in 2011, second in 2005)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="most-frequent-team-picked-first-in-the-preseason">Most frequent team picked first in the preseason</h2>
<ul>
<li>Duke: eight times</li>
<li>The Blue Devils have been picked first in preseason <strong>eight times</strong> (2004, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018)</li>
<li>Duke has only finished first at the end of the regular season <strong>three times</strong> (2004, 2006, 2010)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accuracy-at-the-bottom">Accuracy at the bottom?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The team picked to finish last in the preseason also finished last in the regular season <strong>seven times</strong> (Clemson in 2004, Wake Forest in 2011, Virginia Tech in 2014 &amp; 2015, Boston College in 2016 &amp; 2017, Pittsburgh in 2018)</li>
<li>Yes, the team picked to finish last has a streak of being accurate in five straight seasons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="or-accuracy-at-the-top">Or accuracy at the top?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The squad picked to finish first in the preseason also finished first in the regular season <strong>eight times</strong> (Duke in 2004 &amp; 2006 &amp; 2010, Carolina in 2007 &amp; 2008 &amp; 2009 &amp; 2012 &amp; 2016)</li>
<li>And yes, it&rsquo;s only Duke and Carolina making this projection true</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="most-inaccurate-predictions">Most inaccurate predictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Three squads were picked nine spots <strong>higher</strong> than its actual finish (2010 North Carolina - T1st to 10th, 2008 NC State - 3rd to 12th, 2006 Wake Forest - 3rd to 12th)</li>
<li>Clemson boasts the most inaccurate ranking, picked to finish 13th in 2018 while finishing tied for 3rd at the end of the regular season</li>
