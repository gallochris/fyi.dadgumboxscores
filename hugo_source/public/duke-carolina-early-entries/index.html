<h1 id="duke-carolina-nba-early-entries">Duke &amp; Carolina: NBA Early Entries</h1>

<p>Roy Williams was asked if the nature of the Duke-North Carolina rivalry has changed because of the frequent turnover of the players. Read his response below or <a href="https://youtu.be/tpjAxg_ODgg?t=15m18s">listen to it here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the names of the front. You guys won&rsquo;t believe this, but I think, strongly, we&rsquo;ve had more guys leave early since I&rsquo;ve been here than they have. Period. We just haven&rsquo;t had the one-and-dones. We&rsquo;ve had Marvin, Brandan, Tony. But we&rsquo;ve had more guys leave early for the NBA.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s what the kids should do, if an option is there. I don&rsquo;t have anything against that. I&rsquo;ve said it hundred times. I&rsquo;ve tried to recruit Harry Giles, I tried to recruit Jayson Tatum, I tried to recruit Luke Kennard. You can go down the line. I tried to recruit Zion Williamson.</p>

<p>How can I say something bad about somebody that did something I did, they just did it a lot more successfully?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s changed the rivalry in my viewpoint. I really don&rsquo;t. Whoever they put out there in a Duke shirt, this is the team we&rsquo;re going to try to beat. And I would assume whoever we put out there, they&rsquo;re going to try to beat.</p>

<p>I mean one year I got so mad at my team over there, I took guys out that were just ticking me off. I put in the 5 toughest guys we could find, and we ended up winning the game. Because sometimes you just got to go by the seat of your pants.</p>

<p>Does North Carolina have more players that have left early than Duke since 2003-04?</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roy Williams mentioned Carolina might have more players that left early for the NBA than Duke since he&#39;s been head coach. <br><br>Well, he&#39;s right. <br><br>Since &#39;03-04 season: <br><br>Carolina: 18 early entries<br><br>Duke: 16 early entries<br><br>Thread with each list coming &hellip;</p>&mdash; Dadgum Box Scores (@dadgumboxscores) <a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumboxscores/status/961010394256027649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>The problem? That tweet is actually not true for a couple reasons. Hand is up.</p>

<p>First, Danny Green didn&rsquo;t leave early, he played all 4 years. The confusion here was a result that Green did <a href="https://scout.com/college/north-carolina/Article/Report-Lawson-Ellington-Green-Returning-104523926"><em>test the waters</em></a> in 2008 with teammates Ty Lawson and Wayne Ellington.</p>

<p>And second, counting is sometimes hard. The first mistake threw off the numbers, and the amount is <strong>16 early entries apiece for each team</strong>.</p>

<p>Twitter is a solid medium of communication. But if you make a mistake, it&rsquo;s generally awful. Tons of people let me know that this was wrong, so let&rsquo;s correct it.</p>

<p>Here is the full list with draft position and years of eligibility left:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*870aBEINtvnddlat_Ns3Hg.png" alt="early-entry-chart" /></p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>This list does not include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>transfers that were drafted, but attended one of the schools (Semi Ojeleye, Elliot Williams)</p></li>

<li><p>players that left early because their eligibility was revoked by the NCAA (P.J. Hairston)</p></li>

<li><p>any players prior to the 2003-04 collegiate season</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-are-we-defining-leaving-early">How are we defining leaving early?</h3>

<p>Numerous people pointed out that leaving early and one-and-dones aren&rsquo;t the same thing. That&rsquo;s absolutely right.</p>

<p>But for this exercise, we&rsquo;re lumping them together.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, Duke has more one-and-dones and several more years of eligibility left amongst players that left early.</p>

<pre>
| Early Entries            | Carolina | Duke |
|--------------------------|----------|------|
| One-and-dones            |        3 |   11 |
| Eligibility left (years) |       25 |   41 |
</pre>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re curious about transfers, <a href="https://twitter.com/YellowPadStats/status/959484050103824384">Joe Giglio wrote about that recently</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-this-all-mean">What does this all mean?</h3>

<p>Not really a whole lot. This wasn&rsquo;t intended to insinuate anything. Context is important. Roy Williams answered a question about how it changed the rivalry. And it really hasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>It was a question about the rivalry, not which program is better or more successful.</p>

<p>If anything, you could make a strong case it makes the rivalry better.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because you get to see incredible basketball talent compete against each other twice a year, at minimum.</p>

<p>And, of course, it would be great if you could see these players year and after year compete against each other. But if they can make a living playing basketball, they deserve to do that.</p>
